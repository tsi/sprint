S(imple )Print for Drupal 7
-------------------------------------

This module implements a simple method for having a printable version of your nodes.
All you need is to add a link with a class "print" to your pages.

The concept is to create a printable version of your page on the client side, based on the original theme by simply removing html blocks and adding some css.
